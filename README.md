Automatically apply to avaliable apartments.

The script searches for avaliable apartments according to your set preferences, and if there are avaliable apartments you haven't applied to it will apply and then send you an email with a link to the apartment.

It uses Firefox geckodriver to open a Firefox window to login and save the cookie, but it's probably easier to use requests and beautiful soup. I used geckodriver to recieve a cookie.

You need to edit the post data, sign in user id/password, and email.
